Google has published 101+ GenAI Use cases with technical blueprints [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/real-world-gen-ai-use-cases-with-technical-blueprints/).
All this technical blueprints use Google Cloud Platform services. 

This is my attempt to convert these blueprints from GCP to AWS.
